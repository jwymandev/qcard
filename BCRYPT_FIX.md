# Bcrypt Authentication Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing authentication issues in both local development and production environments:

1. Users could register successfully
2. But immediately after registration, they couldn't log in
3. The error log showed "User not found" even though the user had just been created

## Root Cause

The issue was related to how bcrypt was being implemented:

1. The application had a `bcrypt-wrapper.js` that was supposed to:
   - Use a bcrypt stub during build time to avoid native module requirements
   - Use real bcrypt during production and development

2. The detection of "build time" was incorrect:
   - It was using `!isProduction && process.env.NEXT_BUILD_SKIP_DB === 'true'`
   - But this condition was often true in development, forcing the use of the bcrypt stub

3. When using the bcrypt stub:
   - Passwords were not actually hashed properly
   - All comparisons would return `true`
   - This broke the authentication flow

## Fix

The fix involved three key changes:

1. Updated the environment detection logic:
   ```js
   // Old (incorrect)
   const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
   const isBuildTime = !isProduction && process.env.NEXT_BUILD_SKIP_DB === 'true';

   // New (fixed)
   const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
   const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development';
   const isBuildTime = process.env.NEXT_BUILD_SKIP_DB === 'true';
   ```

2. Simplified the bcrypt implementation selection:
   ```js
   // Only use stub during actual build time, otherwise use real bcrypt
   if (isBuildTime) {
     console.log('Build time detected - using bcrypt stub');
     bcrypt = require('./bcrypt-stub');
   } else {
     // For both production and development, use real bcrypt
     console.log(`Loading real bcrypt for ${isProduction ? 'production' : 'development'} use`);
     bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
     // ... verification logic ...
   }
   ```

3. Enhanced the bcrypt stub to log what it's doing for debugging purposes

## Why NextAuth Uses Bcrypt

NextAuth uses password hashing for security when using the Credentials provider:

1. **Security**: Bcrypt is a secure password hashing algorithm that protects user passwords
2. **Industry standard**: It includes salt and is resistant to brute force attacks
3. **Required for Credentials provider**: When using email/password authentication

While other hashing methods could be used, bcrypt is the recommended approach for password storage.

## Alternatives

If bcrypt continues to cause issues, consider:

1. Using a different hashing library like Argon2 (though this would require more code changes)
2. Using OAuth providers instead of Credentials (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Implementing a custom authentication flow that doesn't rely on password hashing

## Testing Authentication

To verify the fix is working:

1. Clear any database data for existing test users
2. Register a new user
3. Try to log in immediately after registration
4. Check logs to ensure real bcrypt is being used, not the stub

The application should now properly authenticate users in both development and production environments.
