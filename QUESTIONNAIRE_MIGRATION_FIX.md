# Questionnaire Feature Migration Fix

## Problem

When running the questionnaire feature migration script, it was trying to use localhost instead of the correct database URL, causing the migration to fail on the production environment.

## Solution

We've implemented several improvements to fix this issue:

1. **Enhanced Migration Script**: Created `update-schema-and-migrate-enhanced.sh` with the following improvements:
   - Intelligent environment detection that checks for DATABASE_URL in multiple sources:
     - Environment variables
     - `.env.production` file
     - `.env.do` file (for DigitalOcean deployments)
     - `.env` file (for local development)
   - Better error messages and validation
   - Cleaner database connection logging (masking sensitive information)
   - Automatic detection and use of enhanced migration SQL

2. **Enhanced SQL Migration**: Created `enhanced-migration.sql` with:
   - Idempotent SQL operations that can be safely run multiple times
   - IF NOT EXISTS checks for all database objects
   - DO blocks with conditional checks to prevent errors when objects already exist
   - Proper checks before creating indexes and constraints
   - Better error handling for all database operations

3. **Documentation**: Added:
   - `MIGRATION_README.md` with detailed instructions for running migrations
   - This summary document explaining the fixes made

## How to Use

1. **Running the Migration**:
   ```bash
   ./update-schema-and-migrate-enhanced.sh
   ```

2. **Verifying the Migration**:
   - The script will show which database it's connecting to
   - It will report success or failure clearly
   - It automatically tests the build after migration

## Technical Details

1. **Database Connection Detection**:
   - The script now properly detects the DATABASE_URL from the environment
   - It will use the production URL when running in production
   - There's no more hardcoding of localhost

2. **Error Handling**:
   - The migration will fail early if required files are missing
   - It validates the database connection before attempting migration
   - It displays clear error messages if anything goes wrong

3. **Idempotent Migrations**:
   - The enhanced SQL is safe to run multiple times without errors
   - It only creates objects that don't already exist
   - No more duplicate constraint or type errors

## Conclusion

These changes ensure that the migration script respects the correct database connection URL in any environment, making the deployment process much more robust. The enhanced SQL also provides better error handling and idempotency, reducing the risk of failed migrations.
