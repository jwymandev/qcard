# Fixing Client-Side JavaScript Loading in Production

This document describes how to fix the issue where only the HTML version of pages is loading without client-side JavaScript functionality.

## Problem

When deploying the application, pages load without any client-side JavaScript. This results in:
- Static HTML pages without interactivity
- No client-side state management
- No user interactions (forms, buttons, etc.)
- Browser console showing 404 errors for JavaScript assets

## Solution

We've made the following changes to fix client-side JavaScript loading:

1. **Updated Next.js Configuration**
   - Added proper `assetPrefix` setting to ensure assets load from the correct URL
   - Set `publicPath` in webpack configuration for client assets
   - Optimized chunk splitting and asset loading
   - Implemented proper static page handling

2. **Created Asset Fixing Script**
   - Added `scripts/fix-assets-simple.js` to copy static assets to the correct location
   - This ensures JavaScript chunks are available in the standalone output

3. **Simplified Build Process**
   - Updated build script with appropriate environment variables
   - Added `fix-assets` script to package.json

## How to Deploy

1. Build the application with proper asset prefix:
   ```bash
   # Set your application URL
   export NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://your-app-url.com"
   
   # Build the application
   npm run build
   ```

2. Fix assets to ensure client-side JavaScript works:
   ```bash
   npm run fix-assets
   ```

3. Deploy the standalone output to your hosting provider

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues with client-side JavaScript not loading:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for 404 errors on JavaScript files
   - Note which paths are failing to load

2. **Verify Asset Paths**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly
   - Check that assets are being requested from the correct path
   - Inspect HTML source to see if script tags have the correct URLs

3. **Check Static Assets**
   - Verify that `.next/static/chunks` contains JavaScript files
   - Make sure these files are copied to `.next/standalone/.next/static/chunks`
   - Ensure all public assets are properly copied

4. **Rebuild and Deploy**
   - Clear the build cache: `rm -rf .next`
   - Rebuild with proper environment variables
   - Run the fix-assets script
   - Deploy the updated build

## Changes Made

1. **next.config.js**
   - Added `assetPrefix` configuration
   - Added webpack `publicPath` setting
   - Set `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` to true
   - Set `staticPageGenerationTimeout` to 1 to skip problematic static generation

2. **package.json**
   - Updated build script with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_API_ROUTES=1`
   - Added `fix-assets` script

3. **scripts/fix-assets-simple.js**
   - Created script to copy static assets to the standalone output
   - Implemented recursive directory copying for asset management

These changes should ensure that client-side JavaScript loads properly in the deployed application.
