# Files to Commit for Digital Ocean Git Deployment

These are the minimal files you need to commit to your Git repository for a successful Digital Ocean App Platform deployment.

## Required Files

1. `src/lib/db.ts` - Fixed to avoid assignment errors
2. `package.json` - Modified to use safe build commands
3. `scripts/do-deploy.js` - Simplified to avoid external dependencies

## How to Deploy

1. Commit these files:
   ```bash
   git add src/lib/db.ts package.json scripts/do-deploy.js
   git commit -m "Fix build for Digital Ocean deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. Digital Ocean App Platform will automatically detect the changes and deploy your application.

## What Changed

1. **db.ts**: 
   - Fixed the reversed assignment error
   - Simplified the database connection logic
   - Added proper handling for build mode

2. **package.json**:
   - Removed dependency on external shell scripts
   - Added `NEXT_BUILD_SKIP_DB=true` flag to build command
   - Simplified the `do:deploy-full` script

3. **do-deploy.js**:
   - Simplified to avoid dependencies on external scripts
   - Sets a placeholder DATABASE_URL for build
   - Handles building without database connection

## No Need for Shell Scripts

The previous deployment was failing because it was trying to run shell scripts that:
1. Weren't executable on the Digital Ocean environment
2. Contained complex logic that could fail

The new approach uses pure JavaScript and doesn't rely on shell scripts, making it more reliable for Git-based deployment.
